# OMG! Ubuntu! Chrome!

The official [OMG! Ubuntu!](http://omgubuntu.co.uk) Chrome extension

## Availability
The extension is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omg-ubuntu/nhmmlbjenhdockdgpklmdiamollflljn) or can be downloaded from this repo and used as an "unpacked" extension.

## Compatibility
The extension has been tested on Chromium version 22.0.1229.94 on Ubuntu 12.10 and with the latest Chrome dev releases. IndexedDB changed somewhere between Chrome/ium 17 and 22, so the extension may not function properly in versions of Chrome/ium < 22.

- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)
